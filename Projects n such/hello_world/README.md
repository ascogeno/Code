## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

- [ ] I want to make the displayed text larger
- [ ] I want to see if the favicon can be changed too, the default is a feather
- [ ] Maybe add flare, like the text appearing one character at a time in time with sound effects. Not because the program would actually be benefitted from this, but because I want to practice
