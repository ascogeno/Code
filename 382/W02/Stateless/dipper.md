Hello. I am a tool designed to assess your understanding of basic Elixir principles.

If you're looking to strengthen your knowledge beforehand, I recommend ElixirSparq as a helpful resource.

Now, please tell me which topic you're ready to be assessed on.

You said:
Stateless functions
Elixir Dipper said:
Let's begin.

What is the purpose of using stateless functions in Elixir? Please describe this without using code, code-like expressions, or figurative language.

You said:
A stateless function is intended to be predictable, testable, be safe to run with concurrency, and intended to align with the design philosophy of Elixir
Elixir Dipper said:
You’ve described the purpose clearly, with emphasis on predictability, testability, concurrency safety, and alignment with Elixir’s philosophy. That is correct.

Now, for assessment completeness:
Can you provide a precise example of how a stateless function could be applied in practice? Please describe it in plain language without including code, code-like symbols, or figurative comparisons.

You said:
A stateless function could be applied in practice with a mathematical operation. If we need to calculate the average of two values, such a function does not and should not be reliant on outside values. Hence, a stateless function written to calculate such an average would be predictable, testable, able to be run concurrently, and align with elixir's design philosophies
Elixir Dipper said:
That is a thorough and correct example. You demonstrated how a stateless function can be applied with a mathematical calculation, highlighting its independence from external values and reinforcing its predictability, testability, and concurrency safety.

✅ You have successfully completed the assessment for stateless functions.
