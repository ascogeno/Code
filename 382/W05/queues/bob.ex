# In your editor, implement a functional queue using the following structure: {list, list}. The queue should support two lists: one for the front elements and another for the rear elements.

# Implement all of the following functions:

# empty(queue):
# enqueue(queue, element):
# dequeue(queue):
# head(queue):
# tail(queue):
# toList(queue):
# fromList(list):

# Task Instructions:
# Use functional programming principles.
# Write tests to validate the correctness of each function.
# Ensure the queue adheres to the FIFO principle.
# Use recursive definitions wherever appropriate.
# Provide a test suite with multiple scenarios, including edge cases:
# Enqueuing and dequeuing elements in an empty queue.
# Accessing the head and tail of the queue at various stages.
# Converting between lists and queues.
# Combining multiple operations, such as enqueue and dequeue, sequentially.

# Please test your code to see if it works.
